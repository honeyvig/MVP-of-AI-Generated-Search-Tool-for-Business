# MVP-of-AI-Generated-Search-Tool-for-Business


I'd like to develop an MVP of an ai generated search tool for business developers, that's integrated to Gmail and Linked, shows relevant results based on Natural Language Search, and then suggest prompts to create appropriate CTAs to reengage with leads.
----
To develop an MVP for an AI-powered search tool that integrates with Gmail and LinkedIn, utilizes Natural Language Search (NLS), and generates relevant results, we’ll break the development process into key steps. We'll cover:

    Setting up the integration with Gmail and LinkedIn: This will allow the tool to access and retrieve relevant emails and contacts.
    Natural Language Processing (NLP) to process search queries.
    Generating CTAs based on the context and the nature of the leads.

Here’s a Python code skeleton for each part, using APIs and a simple example for the MVP:
Prerequisites:

    Google API for Gmail integration: Google API Documentation.
    LinkedIn API: You'll need access to LinkedIn's API (either through LinkedIn's official developer portal or using a third-party API like linkedin-v2).
    NLP Model: You can use models like spaCy for basic NLP processing or OpenAI’s GPT-3 for more complex NLP tasks like summarizing emails and suggesting CTAs.

Let’s outline the steps and some sample code to get started.
1. Setup Gmail API Integration

To use Gmail API, you need to authenticate the user and retrieve emails. Use the official google-api-python-client library.

pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib

Here’s a Python example to authenticate and fetch emails:

import os
import pickle
import google.auth
from google.auth.transport.requests import Request
from google.oauth2.credentials import Credentials
from googleapiclient.discovery import build

# Setup Gmail API
SCOPES = ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly']

def authenticate_gmail():
    creds = None
    if os.path.exists('token.pickle'):
        with open('token.pickle', 'rb') as token:
            creds = pickle.load(token)
    
    if not creds or not creds.valid:
        if creds and creds.expired and creds.refresh_token:
            creds.refresh(Request())
        else:
            # This needs user authentication via browser
            creds, _ = google.auth.default(scopes=SCOPES)

        with open('token.pickle', 'wb') as token:
            pickle.dump(creds, token)
    
    service = build('gmail', 'v1', credentials=creds)
    return service

def get_emails(service):
    results = service.users().messages().list(userId='me', labelIds=['INBOX'], q="is:unread").execute()
    messages = results.get('messages', [])

    for message in messages:
        msg = service.users().messages().get(userId='me', id=message['id']).execute()
        payload = msg['payload']
        headers = payload['headers']
        for header in headers:
            if header['name'] == 'From':
                print(f"From: {header['value']}")

2. Setup LinkedIn API Integration

You need to authenticate with LinkedIn and fetch connections or profiles. LinkedIn’s official API (or a wrapper like python-linkedin-v2) can help.

pip install python-linkedin-v2

Here’s an example to connect and fetch user information:

from linkedin_v2 import linkedin

API_KEY = 'your-api-key'
API_SECRET = 'your-api-secret'
RETURN_URL = 'your-redirect-url'
ACCESS_TOKEN = 'your-access-token'

# Authenticate
authentication = linkedin.LinkedInAuthentication(API_KEY, API_SECRET, RETURN_URL, linkedin.PERMISSIONS.enums.values())
authentication.token = ACCESS_TOKEN
application = linkedin.LinkedInApplication(authentication)

# Get Profile
def get_profile():
    profile = application.get_profile()
    print(profile)

# Get Connections
def get_connections():
    connections = application.get_connections()
    print(connections)

3. Natural Language Search Processing with GPT-3

For processing the user’s search query and filtering through Gmail and LinkedIn data, you can use OpenAI’s GPT model or any NLP tool like spaCy for text processing.

Install the OpenAI API client:

pip install openai

Here’s a basic example of how to use GPT-3 for NLP processing:

import openai

openai.api_key = 'your-openai-api-key'

def generate_prompt(query):
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        model="text-davinci-003",
        prompt=f"Suggest relevant leads or actions based on this query: {query}",
        max_tokens=100
    )
    return response.choices[0].text.strip()

# Example: Query processing for CTA generation
user_query = "Find leads interested in AI software"
cta_suggestion = generate_prompt(user_query)
print(cta_suggestion)

4. Suggestion of CTAs Based on NLP Results

Based on the NLP processed query, you can generate CTAs (Call to Actions) based on the context of the lead. Here’s an example where GPT-3 suggests a CTA based on the query:

def generate_cta(lead_data):
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        model="text-davinci-003",
        prompt=f"Based on the following lead data, suggest a personalized CTA:\nLead: {lead_data}",
        max_tokens=50
    )
    return response.choices[0].text.strip()

# Sample lead data for CTA suggestion
lead_info = "A business interested in AI software solutions"
cta = generate_cta(lead_info)
print(f"Suggested CTA: {cta}")

5. Connecting Everything

Now, we combine these parts into one system:

    Retrieve emails and LinkedIn connections.
    Process search queries via NLP (using GPT-3).
    Suggest relevant CTAs for reengaging with leads.

def main():
    # Authenticate Gmail and LinkedIn
    gmail_service = authenticate_gmail()
    get_emails(gmail_service)
    
    # Fetch LinkedIn Profile or Connections
    get_profile()
    get_connections()
    
    # Process user query and generate CTAs
    query = input("Enter your query: ")
    cta = generate_cta(query)
    print(f"Suggested CTA: {cta}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

6. Final Steps for MVP

    Front-end Integration: For the MVP, integrate the backend (Python code) with a front-end like React (Next.js) for displaying results, user queries, and CTAs.
    Database: For storing leads and generated results, use a simple Supabase or Firebase backend to keep track of leads and user queries.
    Deploy: You can deploy this MVP on platforms like Vercel or Heroku for easy hosting.

7. Further Improvements

    Scalability: For a production-grade system, you might want to set up more robust search indexing and a database to store lead interactions.
    Better NLP: While GPT-3 is great, you can fine-tune it with your own business data for more accurate suggestions.
    Integrate with CRM: After generating CTAs, integrate the system with CRM tools like Salesforce or HubSpot for full sales funnel management.

This MVP gives you a basic but functional system for AI-driven search and CTA generation integrated with Gmail and LinkedIn!
